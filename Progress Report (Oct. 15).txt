Group Note:


For this phase of the project, most of the coding was handled by one person to ensure consistency, but all design decisions were made collaboratively. We used buddy coding where possible, shared design responsibilities, and provided support through debugging, research, and implementation planning. There’s a lot of overlap in who contributed to which part of the project, so this breakdown reflects a general division of contributions rather than strict ownership.



Zixuan Wen


Past two weeks:

Researched and documented the original game’s mechanics to help guide implementation. Also started working on how to model the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), considering what the agent can actually observe and how that affects the learning setup, to formally define the MDP. Helped review design decisions and took part in group sessions on observation space and algorithm selection.


Next two weeks:

Focus on narrowing down which algorithms to experiment with (currently focusing on Temporal Difference, Monte Carlo, and DQN). Begin outlining how the agent might handle partial observability (e.g., belief state tracking or history-based inputs). Also helping prepare and recording the environment demo.



Milo Goodfellow


Past two weeks:

Focused on the design of the reward function, which we’re using in place of the original idea of enumerating board states. Worked with the team to define a scoring system that balances risk/reward and encourages efficient decision-making. Also contributed to observation and action space discussions.


Next two weeks:

Help finalize the logic for the reward function and prepare it for implementation. Will also be helping test the environment to make sure the game logic behaves correctly, and assist with recording and presenting the demo.



Adrien Gergouil


Past two weeks:

Contributed to the design of both the reward function and observation space. Helped figure out what information the agent should receive from the environment and how that could be structured without leaking hidden information. Participated in working sessions where we finalized action space decisions.


Next two weeks:

Will help with testing and validation the environment, including going through example episodes and checking that rewards and game state updates behave as expected. Plan to help with the environment demo through editing and recording.



Tomas Teixeira


Past two weeks:

Handled the main environment implementation. Took the group's design discussions and coded them into a Gymnasium environment, including the reset and step functions. Started translating the original game logic into Python, making sure the environment can handle level-ups, health and other core mechanics. Also, set up a basic Selenium integration so we could start visualizing the game state while testing.


Next two weeks:

Implement the reward function and finalize the game logic in Python. Will be cleaning up the codebase and testing the environment to make sure everything works reliably. Also preparing the environment to be demo-ready, and assisting with the creation of the demo.



Pierson Michalski


Past two weeks:

Worked on early planning around how to represent the board and game state in Python. Took part in buddy coding sessions with Tomas and helped review the implementation as it was developed. Also contributed to the design of the reward function and worked with others to make sure the logic and behaviour of the environment matched our expectations.


Next two weeks:

Take the lead on testing the environment by running a variety of episodes, looking for any crashes, bugs, or inconsistencies in game behaviour with the original game. Will help verify that the visualization matches the actual game state and will be involved in recording and creating the demo.
